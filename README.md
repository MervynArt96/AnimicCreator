# AnimicCreator

This project is made possible with the use of QT GUI Framework version 5.13. 

The project is made to fulfill the Final Year Project requirements.

.

*PRE-REQUISITE TO RUN THE PROGRAM*

Multimedia codec (I use K-Lite Codec),

Qt5,

Visual Studio with Qt Plugin or Qt Creator

MSVC 2017 x64 Compiler (Other compiler flavour may require some additional setup) 

.

*ADDITIONAL NOTES*

Layer Module is broken and is not included in this repository,

Project Management Module is not developed in the current phase of the project,

Deleting Triggers will crash,

The program can still be unreliable at times

.

*CONCEPT EXPLAINATION*

A multimedia authoring program used to create "Animated comic". An Animated Comic is a rough term that I personally came up with which stands for interactive comic that is animated. It is something like a hybrid between a video game and a movie. It takes the interactive and dynamic features from a video game and embed them into a movie.

*MAJOR SPOILER FOR THE AVENGER SERIES* ... just in case

.

.

For instance, take Marvel's Avenger Infinity War where during near the ending, Thor would throw his axe onto Thanos chest in an attempt to kill him but failed which led to Avenger Endgame. However, we never considered the possibilty of Thor successfully killing Thanos by throwing his axe onto his head and how it would play out. Or the scene where Doctor Strange says that he has seen into the future of millions of possible outcome, yet we were only told about that and never able to experience it. Sure it's no fun to watch our heroes dying and losing all day long. But one can argue that, the writing of the story is also limited by the medium itself. Directors are forced into a single linear path of story telling because movies can only be played from the start till the end linearly, and a branching path is not possible. Thus, the final product presented to the audience must also be the one and only possibility. 

With that said, the project proposed an idea to allow for multiple different storyline to be told which opens up the possibility that if Avengers were to be written for this platform, the story may be written specifically to play out in a few different way that the Avengers may emerge victory, as an example. The proposed idea also allows consumers to interact with the product in a more meaningful and engaging way, such as inputs prompts that mimics the scene that is being displayed, like a QTE in video games. For instance, coming back to the Avenger exmaple, when Thor throws his towards Thanos, Thanos shoots an energy beam towards to axe to push it away form himself. In this case, the "Animated Comic" may require the user do a button mash to simulate the wrestling effort that Thor/Thanos put into the scenario. Other input possibilities includes requiring the user to press a button in time to proceed, drag and drop, simple button click, rolling the joystick in a certain direction, input with multiple branching possibilities, etc. The varied input method may create a whole new layer of engaging interaction with the product, thus allowing the user to retain more information after each session. In which case, this allows the product to have the potential be extended into a children learning platform as well (might be a stretch, but seems reasonable).

And all of these are just optional features that artists/producers can take advantage of to add some flare to their product. None of which is required for the product to work, which make this project powerful and flexible. Creators can just simply drop a single video file into the program and call it a day. The product would then be just like what you would expect from a movie for instance. However, to fully utilize the project's capabilities, creators are encouraged to utilized the features that the program offers to create interactive content for the consumers.

While the interactivity is not for the big screen in a cinema, it does show some potential for personal entertainment at home. By integrating interactive features in each "scene", consumer can choose which path they wish to take for the story. After finishing, they can rewatch the same product but experience a completely different story path should they choose to. Besides that, a single product can contain multiple story path, endings, hidden story path/easter eggs, etc. to increase the value that a consumer may perceive as well.
