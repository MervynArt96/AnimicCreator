# AnimicCreator

This project is made possible with the use of QT GUI Framework version 5.13. 
The project is made to fulfill the Final Year Project requirements in Universiti Sains Malaysia. 

*CONCEPT EXPLAINATION*

A multimedia authoring program used to create "Animated comic". An Animated Comic is a rough term that I personally came up with which stands for interactive comic that is animated. It is something like a hybrid between a video game and a movie. It takes the interactive and dynamic features from a video game and embed them into a movie.

*MAJOR SPOILER FOR THE AVENGER SERIES* ... just in case

For instance, take Marvel's Avenger Infinity War where durign near the ending, Thor would throw his axe onto Thanos chest in an attempt to kill him but failed and have led to Avenger Endgame. However, we never considered the possibilty of Thor successfully killing Thanos by throwing his axe to his head and how it would play out. Or the scene where Doctor Strange says that he has seen into the future of millions of possible outcome, yet we were only told about that and never able to experience it. Sure its no fun to watch our heroes dying and losing all day long. But one can argue that, the writing of the story is also limited by the medium itself. Directors are forced into a single linear path of story telling because movies can only be played from the start till the end, and never a branching path. Thus, the story presented to the audience must also be the one and only possibility. 

Knowing that, this project proposed a different way to enjoy some of the movies that we all have known and loved. The proposed idea allows consumers to interactive with the product in a meaningful way, such as input that mimics the scene that is being displayed. For instance, coming back to the Avenger exmaple, when Thor throws his towards Thanos, Thanos shoots an energy beam towards to axe to push it away form himself. In this case, the "Animated Comic" may require the user do a button mash to simulate the wrestling effort that Thor/Thanos put into the scenario. Other input possibilities includes requiring the user to press a button in time to proceed, drag and drop, simple button click, rolling the joystick in a certain direction, input with multiple branching possibilities, etc. The varied input method may create a whole new layer of engaging interaction with the product, thus allowing the user to retain more information after each session. In which case, this allows the product to have the potential be extended into a children learning platform as well (might be a stretch, but seems reasonable).

While the interactivity is not for the big screen in a cinema, it does show some potential for personal entertainment at home. By integrating interactive features each "scene", consumer can choose which path they wish to take for the story. After finishing, they can rewatch the same product but experience a completely different story path should they choose to. Besides that, a single product can contain multiple story path, endings, hidden story path/easter eggs, etc. to increase the value that a consumer may perceive as well.
